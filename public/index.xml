      <description>Introduction: linkFirewalls are a crucial security component in network infrastructure, designed to prevent unauthorized access to internal resources. This tutorial delves into the techniques used by penetration testers to understand and bypass firewalls during security assessments.&#xA;1. Understanding Firewall Functionality linkFirewalls filter network traffic based on pre-defined rules.&#xA;Common Firewall Types:&#xA;Packet filtering firewalls: Examine individual packets and block or allow them based on source/destination IP address, port, and protocol. Stateful inspection firewalls: Track the state of network connections and make filtering decisions based on the context of the traffic.</description>
